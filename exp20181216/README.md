# Experiment: Simple policy gradient agent in eager execution tensorflow

Experiment #1. In which we build our first deep reinforcement learning, 
a simple policy gradient agent built in a tensorflow 2.0 style.

In this experiment the game is gym-hotforest, an openai gym, for planting
trees on a board and getting a measure of forest yield as a reward.
