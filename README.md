## exp20181216 Vanilla Policy Gradients and Hot Forests

After my frustrations with using OpenAI Baselines deepq on 2x2 hot forests (what was I doing wrong?) and with the coming of the end of the semester, I can finally kick back and write a vanilla policy gradient agent in tensorflow 2.0 style.

It was an exciting moment when I pieced together the training loop and saw the model learn how to play the 2x2 version of the game! Yes, I know, just 2x2, but you got to start somewhere...

There is still a lot of future work to do.
